IMAGE GUIDELINES

This folder is for storing the 100x100px square images used in the website, primarily for:
1. The top square in the corner icon
2. The smile icon/avatar in the corner icon

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 100x100 pixels (exact size recommended)
- Format: .png or .jpg
- For the smile icon/avatar: an image with clean edges works best

To use your images in the website, simply place them in this folder and update the image paths in the App.jsx file.
